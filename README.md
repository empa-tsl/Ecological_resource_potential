# Ecological resource potential (ERP)
This is a method to calcualte the ERP for a material, i.e. the amount of a material that can be extracted, produced and finally disposed off without violating any Earth system boundary with more than a chosen probability.

The ERP method is an adaption of the ecological resource availability (ERA) method (see here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3629366).
